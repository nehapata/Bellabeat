This case study is about Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. It aims to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and use this information to influence the marketing strategy for one of Bellabeat's products.

Through this repository, I am sharing all the R codes that I used to clean, manipulate, analyze and visualize the data.
